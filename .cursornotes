# Cursor Agent Notes - Usage and Guidelines

## Purpose
This file tracks key decisions and lessons learned in the ros_to_markdown project, focusing on what matters most for future development. It's a quick reference, not exhaustive documentation.

<INSTRUCTIONS>
  - Use the bottom of this file as a buffer to keep track of your thoughts.
  - Once the user asks you to update cursornotes, you should consolidate those thoughts into a single cohesive entry.
  - Keep entries brief and focused - aim for 3-5 key points per topic
  - Capture only significant architectural decisions or breaking changes
  - Include dates and impacted components
  - Omit code snippets unless absolutely essential
  - Save detailed implementations for the codebase or documentation
  - Focus on "why" over "what" or "how"
  - You MUST ask the user what todays date is since you are not sure
  - You MUST NOT modify any of the notes, only add new ones
  - New entries must be appended to the end of the file
</INSTRUCTIONS>

Bad Example:
```
# Docker Setup (YYYY-MM-DD)
- <Detailed step-by-step platform configs>
- <Multiple code snippets showing implementations>
- <Exhaustive environment variable listings>
- <Verbose troubleshooting steps>
```

Good Example:
```
# Docker Setup (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Implemented cross-platform X11 handling via environment detection
- Standardized display variables across Linux/WSL/macOS/Windows
- Centralized configuration in docker-compose.yml for maintainability
```

Reference this file when making significant changes or understanding past decisions. Update via "update cursornotes" command.

# Docker X11 Configuration (2025-01-01)
- Chose environment-based platform detection over multiple compose files for simpler maintenance
- Standardized display handling with smart defaults (DISPLAY=:0 for WSL) to improve cross-platform support
- Used host.docker.internal for non-Linux platforms to unify networking approach

Why:
- Multiple compose files would have increased complexity and duplication
- Platform-specific code is now centralized in run-in-docker.sh for easier updates
- Environment variables provide flexibility while maintaining clean compose files

# Test Environment Architecture (2025-01-01)
- Separated dev and production containers for each ROS distribution
- Implemented unified test runner across all ROS versions
- Standardized X11 forwarding configuration across platforms

Why:
- Dev containers enable testing without impacting production images
- Single test runner reduces maintenance overhead and ensures consistent behavior
- Platform-agnostic X11 setup simplifies cross-platform development and testing

# Rolling/Jazzy Docker Support (2025-01-01)
- Using Python 3.11 from deadsnakes PPA with symlinked ROS2 packages
- Created hybrid environment that bridges Python 3.11 venv with ROS2's Python 3.12
- Implemented symlink solution to access ROS2 packages from Python 3.11 venv
- Added explicit PYTHONPATH handling for cross-version compatibility

Why:
- Ubuntu 24.04's system Python 3.12 enforces strict PEP 668 package management
- ROS2 Rolling/Jazzy requires Python 3.12 for core functionality
- Development tools and tests need pip-installable packages (blocked by PEP 668)
- Solution: Use Python 3.11 venv with symlinks to ROS2's Python 3.12 packages

Technical Details:
- Python 3.11 venv hosts our package and development dependencies
- Symlinks from ROS2's Python 3.12 site-packages to venv's site-packages
- Modified PYTHONPATH includes both Python versions' package directories
- Verified compatibility with ROS2 core functionality and test suite

Known Limitations:
- Potential ABI compatibility issues between Python versions
- May need updates when ROS2 packages change
- Not suitable for production (development/testing only)

Future Plans:
- Monitor ROS2 Rolling/Jazzy for Python package management solutions
- Investigate containerized test isolation approaches
- Plan migration to full Python 3.12 when package management improves

# Python Version Mismatch in Rolling/Jazzy (2025-01-01)
- Currently running tests in Python 3.11 while ROS uses 3.12
- This is a temporary solution that needs to be addressed
- Potential issues with ABI compatibility and ROS package interactions

Why:
- Ubuntu 24.04 enforces strict system package management
- ROS Rolling/Jazzy uses system Python 3.12
- Our test infrastructure currently requires more flexible package management

TODO:
- Plan migration to Python 3.12 for test infrastructure
- Investigate proper isolation techniques for system Python
- Consider container-based test isolation approach

# Docker Configuration and Testing Improvements (2025-01-01)
- Consolidated Docker configuration into docker-compose.yml for better maintainability and consistent behavior
- Standardized volume mounting, working directory setup, and test execution across all ROS environments
- Simplified command handling in run-in-docker.sh and added persistent test coverage tracking
- Improved cross-platform compatibility by moving complex configuration to Docker Compose

Why:
- Needed unified approach across ROS distributions with persistent coverage data
- Complex shell escaping was causing cross-platform issues
- Required standardized workspace and permission handling

Technical Details:
- Moved to explicit volume configuration in docker-compose.yml with :rw flags
- Centralized workspace configuration and environment setup
- Implemented proper file permissions for coverage data persistence
- Simplified shell scripts to focus on environment setup and command delegation
