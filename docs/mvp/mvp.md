# MVP Discussion and Decisions

## Evolution of Our Thinking

Our discussion about the MVP emerged from a critical realization: we were trying to build something too complex too quickly. The perspective system we designed is powerful and flexible, but we need to start smaller and prove the core concept first.

What really crystallized our thinking was the example of analyzing a high-frequency camera topic. Initially, we thought about showing all the message data, but this led us to a key insight: users don't need (or want) to see every message. They need to understand patterns, relationships, and potential issues. This realization helped shape our entire MVP approach.

## Core MVP Philosophy

We're building a tool that needs to work in real robotics environments. This means:

1. It must run alongside production systems without interfering
2. It should work on anything from embedded systems to powerful workstations
3. It must provide immediate, actionable value to ROS developers

This led us to some hard but important decisions. For instance, we decided to limit memory usage to 1GB for embedded systems. This isn't an arbitrary number - it comes from the reality that many robotics systems run on hardware with 4GB RAM, and we can't justify using more than 25% of that.

## What We're Building First (And Why)

The MVP will focus exclusively on runtime analysis. While our perspective system supports static analysis, historical data, and complex compositions, starting with runtime gives us:

1. Immediate feedback - users can see their running system
2. Clear value proposition - understand what's happening right now
3. Simpler implementation - no need to parse code or maintain history
4. Faster iteration - easier to test and validate

## The Data Challenge

One of our most important discussions centered around data collection. We realized there are actually two distinct types of metrics we need to consider:

1. ROS System Metrics
   - Node health and connectivity
   - Topic frequencies and patterns
   - Resource usage by ROS components

2. Tool Performance Metrics
   - Our own memory and CPU usage
   - Collection success rates
   - Analysis timing

For the MVP, we're explicitly NOT doing:
- Historical trend analysis
- Raw message capture
- Complex statistical analysis
- Cross-system comparisons

Instead, we're focusing on providing clear, accurate snapshots of the current system state. This was a crucial decision that significantly simplifies our initial implementation.

## The Scale Problem

A major challenge we discussed was handling large ROS systems. The reality is that production systems might have:
- Hundreds of nodes
- Thousands of topics
- Multiple namespaces
- High-frequency data flows

Our initial thought was to use a whitelist approach - let users specify what they care about. But we realized this might be too restrictive. We left this as an open question that needs more thought, but we have some initial ideas:
- Progressive loading (get basic info first, then details)
- Smart filtering based on activity levels
- Namespace-based organization
- Priority-based collection

## Performance and Reliability

We had a breakthrough when discussing performance targets. Instead of trying to be real-time, we agreed that taking up to one minute for analysis is acceptable. This gives us room to:
1. Collect meaningful samples
2. Handle collection failures gracefully
3. Generate thoughtful insights
4. Provide progress updates to users

For reliability, we're taking a pragmatic approach. Yes, nodes might disappear during analysis. Yes, network issues might interrupt data collection. But for the MVP, we're focusing on:
1. Basic error detection
2. Exponential backoff for retries
3. Clear reporting of what worked and what didn't
4. Graceful degradation when things go wrong

## The Insight Challenge

Perhaps our most interesting discussion was about what makes an insight "useful". We acknowledged this is inherently subjective, but we have a vision:

Short term (MVP):
- Focus on clear, factual observations
- Highlight obvious patterns
- Call out potential issues
- Use basic heuristics

Long term:
- Integrate with LLMs for deeper analysis
- Learn from user feedback
- Support custom insight generation
- Enable interactive exploration

## Output Accuracy

The question of validating output accuracy remains partially open. This is a complex issue because we're often dealing with dynamic, real-time systems where "ground truth" can be elusive. We need to think more about:
- How to verify our frequency calculations
- Validating resource usage measurements
- Ensuring connection graphs are accurate
- Dealing with temporal inconsistencies in data collection

## Next Steps

Before diving into implementation, we should:
1. Finalize our approach to handling large systems
2. Define specific accuracy requirements where possible
3. Create a more detailed error handling strategy
4. Design the progress reporting system

## MVP Goals
1. Demonstrate the power of perspectives
2. Provide immediate value to ROS developers
3. Validate core architectural decisions
4. Get early user feedback
5. Keep implementation complexity manageable

## Phase 1: Core Runtime Analysis
Focus on analyzing running ROS systems - this provides immediate value and avoids the complexity of static analysis.
