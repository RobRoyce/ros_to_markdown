# ROS-to-Markdown Perspective System

## Design Evolution & Discussion

### Initial Problem
Our initial implementation tried to handle everything at once - static analysis, runtime data, and historical data. This led to:
- Confusing data hierarchies (nodes nested in packages)
- Unclear data sources (where did this node info come from?)
- Difficulty generating focused views
- Complex filtering logic

### Key Realizations

During our discussion, several important insights emerged:

1. **Mode Separation**
   - Users typically focus on one type of analysis at a time
   - Mixing modes creates confusion and complexity
   - Each mode should have a clear, single source of truth
   - BUT: We want the ability to combine modes in powerful ways when needed

2. **User Needs**
   - Users rarely need ALL information about their ROS system
   - Different tasks require different views:
     - Debugging might focus on a specific node chain
     - Performance analysis needs system-wide metrics
     - Documentation requires structural information
   - Views should be task-oriented, not data-oriented

3. **Composition Power**
   - Simple primitives can combine to create complex insights
   - Example: Combining node CPU usage with message frequency might reveal bottlenecks
   - Users might discover relationships we never anticipated
   - Need flexibility without overwhelming complexity

### The Perspective Concept

The breakthrough came when discussing how to organize views of ROS systems. We realized we needed:

1. **Flexible Building Blocks**
   ```
   Discussion Point: "Should we maintain separate models for static vs runtime data?"
   Decision: Keep core models consistent but allow different collection methods
   Rationale: Same node concept, different data sources
   ```

2. **Clear Data Flow**
   ```
   Discussion Point: "Should we merge data from multiple sources?"
   Decision: Keep sources separate but allow controlled composition
   Rationale: Avoid confusion, maintain data lineage
   ```

3. **Powerful Composition**
   ```
   Discussion Point: "How do we handle conflicts?"
   Decision: Make data source explicit, use composition rules
   Rationale: Users should always know where data comes from
   ```

### Implementation Challenges

Several challenging questions emerged:

1. **Natural Language Insights**
   ```
   Q: "How would you ascertain that information about LIDAR limiting rate?"
   A: Need multiple layers:
   - Raw data analysis (frequency measurements)
   - Pattern recognition (rate matching)
   - Domain knowledge application
   - Natural language generation
   ```

2. **Performance Considerations**
   ```
   Q: "Should we support parallel/concurrent processing?"
   A: Yes, essential for:
   - Real-time analysis
   - Large systems
   - Multiple perspectives
   Challenge: Managing async operations and data consistency
   ```

3. **Extension Mechanism**
   ```
   Q: "Should we allow custom primitives beyond ROS?"
   A: Yes, needed for:
   - System metrics (CPU, memory)
   - Custom sensors
   - Application-specific data
   Challenge: Maintaining consistency while allowing flexibility
   ```

### Future Considerations

1. **Advanced Output Formats**
   - Current: Focus on Markdown for simplicity
   - Future possibilities:
     - Interactive HTML
     - Jupyter notebooks
     - Grafana dashboards
     - Real-time updates

2. **Integration Opportunities**
   - IDE plugins for development-time insights
   - CI/CD pipeline integration
   - Monitoring system integration
   - LLM-powered analysis

3. **Scaling Considerations**
   - Large ROS systems (100s of nodes)
   - High-frequency data collection
   - Complex perspective compositions
   - Resource management

### Open Questions

1. **Perspective Complexity**
   - How much power should we give users?
   - Should we allow arbitrary Python code in perspectives?
   - How do we validate custom perspectives?

2. **Data Management**
   - How long should we retain collected data?
   - Should we support persistent storage?
   - How do we handle missing data?

3. **User Experience**
   - How do we make this power accessible?
   - What's the learning curve for custom perspectives?
   - How do we handle errors and validation?

## Overview

The perspective system is a powerful, extensible framework for analyzing and visualizing ROS systems. It enables users to:
- Define custom views of their ROS system
- Compose complex analyses from simple primitives
- Create reusable analysis patterns
- Generate insights across different analysis modes

## Core Concepts

### 1. Primitives
Base units that can be analyzed and composed:

```yaml
primitives:
  # ROS Core Primitives
  node:
    attributes: [name, namespace, package, pid]
    metrics: [cpu_usage, memory_usage, uptime]
    relationships: [publishes, subscribes, provides]
    
  topic:
    attributes: [name, type, qos]
    metrics: [frequency, bandwidth, latency]
    relationships: [published_by, subscribed_by]
    
  # System Primitives
  process:
    attributes: [pid, command, user]
    metrics: [cpu_percent, memory_percent, io_stats]
    
  host:
    attributes: [hostname, os, cpu_count]
    metrics: [load_avg, memory_available, network_io]
```

### 2. Relationships
Connections between primitives:

```yaml
relationships:
  # Direct ROS Relationships
  publishes:
    from: node
    to: topic
    attributes: [queue_size, reliability]
    metrics: [publish_rate, dropped_msgs]
    
  # Derived Relationships
  data_flow:
    from: topic
    to: topic
    via: node
    attributes: [transformation_type]
    metrics: [processing_time, success_rate]
```

### 3. Analysis Pipeline
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Collection] --> B[Processing]
    B --> C[Analysis]
    C --> D[Insight Generation]
    D --> E[Presentation]
    
    subgraph "Pipeline Stages"
    A
    B
    C
    D
    E
    end
```

Each stage can be customized:
```yaml
pipeline:
  collection:
    parallel: true
    timeout: 30s
    retry:
      attempts: 3
      backoff: exponential
      
  processing:
    batch_size: 1000
    workers: 4
    
  analysis:
    modules: [frequency, latency, resource]
    depth: 2
    
  insights:
    templates: [bottlenecks, anomalies]
    threshold: 0.8
```

### 4. Perspective Definition

```yaml
perspective:
  name: "Data Flow Analysis"
  description: "Analyze data transformations and bottlenecks"
  version: "1.0"
  modes: [runtime, historical]  # Supported analysis modes
  
  # Input specification
  inputs:
    required:
      - type: topic
        pattern: "/*/sensor_*"
    optional:
      - type: node
        pattern: "*/processor_*"
        
  # Analysis stages
  stages:
    - name: "collect_metrics"
      type: collection
      config:
        metrics: [frequency, latency]
        window: 60s
        
    - name: "analyze_flow"
      type: analysis
      depends_on: ["collect_metrics"]
      config:
        module: data_flow
        params:
          max_depth: 3
          include_transforms: true
          
    - name: "detect_bottlenecks"
      type: analysis
      depends_on: ["analyze_flow"]
      config:
        module: bottleneck_detection
        params:
          sensitivity: 0.8
          
  # Output configuration
  output:
    template: "data_flow.md.j2"
    format: markdown
    sections:
      - flow_diagram
      - bottleneck_analysis
      - performance_metrics
```

### 5. Composition System

Perspectives can be composed using:

```yaml
perspective:
  name: "System Health"
  compose:
    - perspective: data_flow
      params:
        sensitivity: 0.9
        
    - perspective: resource_usage
      params:
        metrics: [cpu, memory]
        
  merge:
    strategy: overlay
    priority: [resource_usage, data_flow]
```

        # Execute stages
        results = await pipeline.execute(context)
        
        # Generate output

- Resource usage needs to be predictable and manageable

**Requirements:**
- [ ] Asynchronous data collection
- [ ] Data sampling strategies
- [ ] Resource usage limits
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Caching mechanisms

### 2. Error Handling & Recovery
**Discussion:**
The distributed nature of ROS systems means we need robust error handling:

- System resources might become constrained
- User-defined perspectives might have bugs

**Requirements:**
- [ ] Graceful degradation
- [ ] Partial results handling
- [ ] Clear error reporting
- [ ] Recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Data validation at boundaries

### 3. Security & Access Control
**Discussion:**
When analyzing running systems, we need to consider:
- Access to system metrics requires privileges
- Network access for remote systems
- Protection against malicious perspective definitions
- Data privacy concerns

**Requirements:**
- [ ] Privilege management
- [ ] Secure connections
- [ ] Perspective validation
- [ ] Data sanitization
- [ ] Access logging
