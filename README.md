Convert ROS systems to Markdown for LLM processing.

## Overview
`ros-to-markdown` is a Python tool that generates comprehensive Markdown documentation from ROS1 and ROS2 systems. It analyzes running ROS systems and generates documentation optimized for consumption by LLMs and AI agents.

### Current Features
- [x] Runtime System Analysis
  - Node discovery and relationships
  - Topic connections and message types
  - Basic system topology
- [x] Markdown Generation
  - Mermaid diagrams for system visualization
  - Structured documentation
  - Namespace filtering
  - Node/topic filtering

### Roadmap
- [ ] Performance Analysis
  - System metrics collection
  - Resource usage monitoring
  - Performance insights
  - Non-intrusive analysis
- [ ] Static Analysis
  - Package structure analysis
  - Source code documentation
  - Build configuration insights
- [ ] Historical Analysis
  - ROS bag file analysis
  - Performance trends
  - Pattern detection
- [ ] Advanced Features
  - Custom analysis perspectives
  - Plugin system
  - Interactive visualizations
  - Resource management

## Installation

```bash
pip install ros-to-markdown
```

## Usage

Run in your ROS workspace root:

## Project Status
> [!Note]
> This repository started as an experiment to see how good current AI tools are at creating complex projects. The vast majority of code was generated by AI (Cursor with Claude 3.5 Sonnet), with almost no code written directly by the authors. That said, the authors did write the documentation and project structure, and spent a **lot** of time iterating with the AI to make it all work. Lessons learned will follow once the project nears completion.
